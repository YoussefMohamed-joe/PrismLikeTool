- **Maya Bridge** with advanced workfile management and scene operations
- **Thumbnail generation** for DCC files with app-specific rendering
- **Workfile templates** for consistent naming conventions

### ðŸ“‹ Professional Version Manager UI
- **Entity-based version management** (Assets and Shots)
- **Context menus** for right-click version creation
- **Status tracking** (WIP, Review, Approved, Published)
- **Version comparison** and history viewing
- **Professional table interface** with sorting and filtering

### ðŸ”§ Version Actions
- **Open with DCC app** - Launch the appropriate DCC application with the version
- **Copy version** - Copy path to clipboard or duplicate the file
- **Delete version** - Remove version and associated files
- **Thumbnail preview** - Visual representation of each version

### ðŸŽ¯ Task-Based Workflow
- **Task assignment** for each version (modeling, animation, lighting, etc.)
- **Department organization** with color-coded status
- **User tracking** and comment system
- **Date and time stamps** for all operations

- **Thumbnail generation** using Maya's playblast system
- **Scene validation** and info extraction

#### Other DCC Apps
Basic integration includes:
- **File detection** and validation
- **Thumbnail generation** (placeholder or app-specific)
- **Launch capabilities** with proper project context

## File Structure

```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **DCCManager** (`src/vogue_core/dcc_integration.py`)
   - Manages DCC application detection and integration
   - Handles workfile creation and thumbnail generation
   - Provides unified interface for all DCC apps

2. **MayaBridge** (`src/vogue_maya/maya_bridge.py`)
   - Specialized Maya integration
   - Advanced workfile management
   - Scene metadata and validation

3. **VersionManager UI** (`src/vogue_app/ui.py`)
   - Professional version management interface
   - Context menus and action handling
   - Real-time updates and synchronization

4. **Enhanced Version Model** (`src/vogue_core/models.py`)
   - Extended Version class with DCC support
   - Status tracking and metadata
   - Thumbnail and workfile path management

### Key Features Implementation

#### Auto-Detection
```python
# Automatically detects installed DCC applications
dcc_manager = DCCManager()
apps = dcc_manager.list_apps()
```

#### Version Creation
```python
# Create version with DCC app
version = manager.create_dcc_version(
    entity_key="Character_Hero",
    dcc_app="maya",
    task_name="modeling",
    user="Artist",
    comment="Initial model"
)
```

#### Thumbnail Generation
```python
# Generate thumbnail for DCC file
success = dcc_manager.generate_thumbnail(
    file_path="workfile.ma",
    output_path="thumbnail.png",
    size=(256, 256)
)
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_version_management.py
```

This will:
1. Test DCC application detection
2. Create a test project with assets
3. Generate versions using DCC apps
4. Test version management features
5. Verify DCC app launching

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Maya integration** with MEL/Python scripting
- **Blender bridge** with Python API integration
- **Houdini bridge** with HScript/Python support
- **Version comparison** tools
- **Batch operations** for multiple versions
- **Render management** integration
- **Pipeline validation** rules

### Extensibility
The system is designed to be easily extensible:
- Add new DCC apps by extending the DCCApp class
- Create custom bridges for specialized workflows
- Implement custom thumbnail generation
- Add validation rules and pipeline checks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DCC apps not detected**
   - Ensure DCC applications are properly installed
   - Check executable paths in DCCManager
   - Verify file permissions

2. **Thumbnail generation fails**
   - Check DCC app availability
   - Verify file paths and permissions
   - Check Maya Python installation for Maya files

3. **Version creation errors**
   - Ensure project is loaded
   - Check file system permissions
   - Verify DCC app integration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```python
from vogue_core.logging_utils import setup_logging
setup_logging(level="DEBUG")
```
