# Task Selection and Version Management Features

## Overview

I've implemented the requested features to make task selection behave like departments and added comprehensive right-click functionality for version creation, similar to Prism VFX.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. **Task Selection Behavior (Like Departments)**

#### Persistent Selection
- **Single Selection Mode**: Tasks now use single selection mode instead of extended selection
- **Auto-Selection**: When an asset is selected, the first task is automatically selected
- **Persistent Selection**: Task selection persists when clicking elsewhere (like departments)
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected tasks remain highlighted even when focus is lost

#### Selection Maintenance
- **Focus Events**: Override focus in/out events to maintain selection
- **Mouse Events**: Custom mouse press handling to preserve selection
- **Timer-Based Maintenance**: Periodic checks ensure selection is maintained
- **Scroll to Selection**: Selected items are automatically scrolled into view

### 2. **Enhanced Version Manager**

#### Entity Display
- **Task Context**: Version manager now shows "AssetName - TaskName" format
- **Dynamic Updates**: Display updates when different tasks are selected
- **Context Awareness**: Version manager knows which task is currently selected

#### Right-Click Functionality
- **Always Available**: Right-click context menu always shows version creation options
- **DCC App Integration**: Create versions with any available DCC application
- **Task Pre-filling**: Version creation dialog pre-fills the current task name
- **Version Actions**: Open, copy, and delete versions with DCC apps

### 3. **Professional Context Menus**

#### Version Table Context Menu
- **Create Version**: Always available at the top of the context menu
- **DCC App Options**: Submenu with all available DCC applications
- **Version Actions**: Open, copy, and delete for selected versions
- **Smart Organization**: Separators and logical grouping of actions

#### Version Creation Dialog
- **Task Pre-filling**: Current task name is automatically filled
- **DCC App Context**: Shows which DCC app is being used
- **Entity Information**: Displays the asset being versioned
- **File Browser**: Browse for existing workfiles
- **Validation**: Ensures required fields are filled

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Task Selection System

```python
# Task selection behavior setup
self.tasks_list.setSelectionMode(QAbstractItemView.SelectionMode.SingleSelection)
self.tasks_list.setFocusPolicy(Qt.FocusPolicy.StrongFocus)

# Event overrides for persistent selection
self.tasks_list.focusOutEvent = self.task_list_focus_out
self.tasks_list.focusInEvent = self.task_list_focus_in
self.tasks_list.mousePressEvent = self.task_list_mouse_press
```

### Version Manager Integration

```python
# Enhanced entity update with task context
def update_entity(self, entity_name: str, entity_type: str = "Asset", task_name: str = None):
    self.current_entity = entity_name
    self.current_task = task_name
    
    if task_name:
        self.entity_name_label.setText(f"{entity_name} - {task_name}")
    else:
        self.entity_name_label.setText(entity_name)
```

### Context Menu System

```python
# Always-available version creation
def show_version_context_menu(self, position):
    menu = QMenu(self)
    
    # Always add version creation options at the top
    self.add_dcc_creation_menu(menu)
    
    # Add version-specific actions if version is selected
    if current_version:
        # Open, copy, delete actions
```

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### 1. **Intuitive Task Management**
- Tasks behave exactly like departments with persistent selection
- No more accidental deselection when clicking elsewhere
- Clear visual feedback for selected tasks
- Automatic selection of first task when asset is selected

### 2. **Streamlined Version Creation**
- Right-click anywhere in version table to create versions
- Task name is automatically filled based on current selection
- DCC app context is clearly shown
- Professional dialog with all necessary information

### 3. **Professional Workflow**
- Version manager shows full context (Asset - Task)
- Context menus are always available and well-organized
- DCC app integration is seamless and intuitive
- File management is handled automatically

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### Task Selection
1. **Select an Asset**: Choose any asset in the left panel
2. **Automatic Task Selection**: First task is automatically selected
3. **Change Task**: Click on different tasks - they stay selected
4. **Persistent Selection**: Selection persists when clicking elsewhere

### Version Creation
1. **Right-Click**: Right-click anywhere in the version table
2. **Choose DCC App**: Select "Create Version with..." ‚Üí Choose DCC app
3. **Fill Details**: Task name is pre-filled, add comment if needed
4. **Create Version**: Click "Create Version" to generate

### Version Management
1. **View Versions**: Select asset and task to see versions
2. **Open with DCC**: Right-click version ‚Üí "Open with [DCC App]"
3. **Copy Version**: Right-click version ‚Üí "Copy Version"
4. **Delete Version**: Right-click version ‚Üí "Delete Version"

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Core UI Changes
- `src/vogue_app/ui.py`
  - Updated `ProjectBrowser` with task selection behavior
  - Enhanced `VersionManager` with task context
  - Added persistent selection methods
  - Improved context menu system

### Controller Updates
- `src/vogue_app/controller.py`
  - Added task selection maintenance
  - Updated selection timer to handle both departments and tasks
  - Enhanced selection event handling

### Test Files
- `test_task_selection.py` - Test script for new functionality
- `TASK_SELECTION_AND_VERSION_FEATURES.md` - This documentation

## üé® Visual Improvements

### Task List Styling
- Single selection mode for cleaner appearance
- Persistent highlighting of selected tasks
- Smooth visual feedback for interactions

### Version Manager Display
- Clear "AssetName - TaskName" format
- Context-aware information display
- Professional table layout with status indicators

### Context Menus
- Well-organized action grouping
- Clear DCC app icons and names
- Logical separation of create vs. manage actions

## üîç Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_task_selection.py
```

This will:
1. Create a test project with departments and tasks
2. Verify task selection behavior
3. Test version creation workflow
4. Validate context menu functionality

## üéØ Benefits

### For Artists
- **Intuitive Workflow**: Tasks behave like departments (familiar behavior)
- **Quick Version Creation**: Right-click anywhere to create versions
- **Context Awareness**: Always know which asset and task you're working on
- **DCC Integration**: Seamless integration with Maya, Blender, etc.

### For Pipeline
- **Consistent Behavior**: Tasks and departments work the same way
- **Professional Interface**: Context menus and dialogs like Prism
- **Task Tracking**: Clear association between assets, tasks, and versions
- **DCC App Support**: Full integration with professional DCC applications

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Task Status Updates**: Visual indicators for task progress

- **Right-click version creation** with DCC app integration
- **Context-aware interface** that shows asset and task information
- **Professional workflow** that streamlines the creative process

These improvements make Vogue Manager more intuitive and efficient for VFX artists and pipeline managers, bringing it closer to professional tools like Prism while maintaining its unique features and flexibility.
